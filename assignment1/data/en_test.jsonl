He slipped and fell into the pond.\n\nLily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.\n\n\"Ben, Ben, grab the stick!\" she shouted. \"I'll pull you out!\"\n\nBen heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.\n\n\"Thank you, Lily!\" he said. \"You saved me!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Ben!\" Lily said. \"I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure.\"\n\nBen shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, \"No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend.\"\n\nThey hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy."}
{"text": "Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.\n\n\"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?\" Lily asked.\n\n\"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared,\" Mom said.\n\nLily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.\n\n\"Thank you, swan!\" Lily said.\n\nThe swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.\n\n\"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?\" Lily called.\n\nThe hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.\n\n\"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend,\" Lily said.\n\nShe threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.\n\n\"Thank you, Lily!\" The hidden swan said.\n\nLily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.\n\n\"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?\" Lily asked.\n\n\"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't,\" End said.\n\n\"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special,\" Lily said.\n\nEnd smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.\n\n\"Thank you, Lily. You're special too.

Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you,\" Ben said.\n\n\"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?\" End said.\n\n\"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End,\" Ben said.\n\n\"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben,\" End said.\n\nMom saw them and was shocked.\n\n\"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?\" Mom asked.\n\n\"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?\" Lily said.\n\n\"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?\" Mom asked.\n\n\"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?\" Lily said.\n\nMom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.\n\n\"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?\" End said.\n\nMom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.\n\n\"Please, Mom. Please,\" they said.\n\nMom sighed. She smiled too.\n\n\"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?\" Mom said.\n\n\"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom,\" End said.\n\nLily, Ben, and End hugged Mom. They were happy. They had a new friend. A talking swan. His name was End. But his story was just beginning."}

How does that sound?\" Mom asked.\n\nLily and Tom nodded. They liked that idea. They hoped the cat would be their new friend.\n\nThey got back in the car and drove to the vet.
